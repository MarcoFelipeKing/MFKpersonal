      "abstract": "Far-UVC light at 222 nm has emerged as a promising technology for inactivating airborne pathogens while remaining safe for human exposure. This study develops a computational framework combining CFD-based airflow simulation with pathogen transport and UV dose-response modelling to evaluate the effectiveness of Far-UVC in reducing infection transmission risk in occupied spaces. Results demonstrate that Far-UVC can achieve equivalent air changes of 20–30 ACH under typical operating conditions, significantly outperforming conventional ventilation strategies.",
